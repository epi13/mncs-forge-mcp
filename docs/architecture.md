# Architecture and trust boundaries

Forge controls an agent-facing workflow; it does not decide normative conformance. It separates:

1. Codex interaction over local stdio MCP;
2. deterministic analyzer interaction over MNCS Provider Protocol 0.1;
3. replaceable declared compiler, analyzer, test, mutation, sanitizer, benchmark, and harness
   commands; and
4. public offline MNCS and MNCDS validators.

Development mode can see declared contracts, references, and development evidence, register
candidates, run declared development workflows, compare candidates under the configured policy,
and write only candidate/generated/output/Forge-state paths. Evaluator mode requires frozen
candidate, evaluator, policy, contract, reference, protected, environment, and evidence-plan
identities. It checks identity drift before and after each run and withholds repair details under
status-only disclosure.

The Forge state directory is `.mncs-forge/`. Epoch, candidate, action, result, selection,
rejection, freeze, evaluation, and bundle records are immutable files plus a locked hash-linked
JSONL ledger. Supersession and lineage are explicit.
