# Rights & Provenance in Forge

Status: experimental integration of `mncs-rights-provenance` manifest contract `0.1.0`.

Forge is the first operational consumer of the MNCS Rights & Provenance framework because Forge already owns candidate lineage, declared development/evidence workflows, selection boundaries, and evidence reconciliation. This integration deliberately does **not** move legal authority into Forge.

## Boundary

The intended family split is:

```text
mncs-rights-provenance   defines vocabulary and versioned manifest semantics
          |
          v
        Forge            collects, binds, assesses, and applies configured process policy
       /     \
      v       v
  Fabric     Commons     execution facts / institutional findings and decisions
      \       /
       v     v
     validators          bounded validation under their declared authority
```

Forge may establish facts such as:

- a manifest conforms to the pinned schema;
- a manifest is bound to the candidate being evaluated;
- provenance validation is passed, failed, incomplete, or not run;
- a declared rights basis is present or explicitly unresolved;
- third-party sources and their declared license status are present, missing, incompatible, or unknown;
- a candidate has Fabric execution-receipt bindings;
- a project configured observe, advisory, or enforced treatment of this evidence.

Forge does **not** establish:

- copyrightability;
- legal authorship or ownership;
- non-infringement;
- public-domain status merely from machine origin;
- legal compatibility beyond the evidence declared to it;
- certification or legal clearance.

Every assessment therefore emits `legal_conclusion: NOT_MADE` and retains explicit limitations.

## Configuration

Rights/provenance is opt-in and non-blocking by default:

```toml
[rights_provenance]
mode = "observe"
manifest = "evidence/rights-provenance.json"
```

`manifest` is optional. When absent, Forge derives a conservative schema-valid draft from the candidate and execution facts it actually knows. Unknown facts remain unknown.

### `observe`

Default. Forge reports rights/provenance alongside technical evidence and records a selection-time snapshot, but it never changes selection eligibility.

### `advisory`

Forge reports `REVIEW_REQUIRED` when the rights/provenance evidence domain is not PASS. It still does not block candidate selection.

### `enforced`

An explicit project policy. Candidate selection is blocked when the rights/provenance evidence domain is FAIL or UNKNOWN. A PASS means only that the configured evidence requirements represented by this integration are complete; it is **not** a legal clearance result.

## Existing Forge surfaces

This first integration intentionally uses existing Forge inspection surfaces rather than introducing a parallel control plane.

`mncs-forge status` / `mncs_forge_claim_status` now returns a separate `rights_provenance` projection.

`mncs-forge blockers rights_provenance` / `mncs_forge_claim_blockers` reports rights/provenance-specific unresolved evidence. Promotion blockers include this domain only when `mode = "enforced"`.

`evidence.reconcile` retains technical/development `required_gate_aggregation` unchanged and places the rights/provenance projection in the reconciliation record's extensions. This prevents a technical PASS from silently becoming a rights PASS or vice versa.

Candidate comparison reports rights/provenance beside each candidate's technical evidence. When a candidate is selected, its current rights/provenance assessment is retained in the candidate-disposition record's `extensions` field.

## Contract handling

Forge packages a pinned copy of the `mncs-rights-provenance` `0.1.0` manifest schema. The package identifies the upstream contract as:

```text
mncs-rights-provenance/manifest@0.1.0
```

The bundled schema is an interoperability contract, not a fork of the specification. Semantic changes belong in `mncs-rights-provenance`; Forge should update its pinned version deliberately after compatibility review.

## Fabric evidence

When Forge derives a draft manifest it incorporates existing candidate-bound execution receipt identities as `fabric-receipt` process evidence. Fabric remains the authority for what execution occurred; Forge does not reinterpret a Fabric receipt as conformance, independence, protected custody, or legal provenance.

## Commons integration

This PR does not modify Commons. Rights/provenance findings that outlive one candidate assessment—decisions, open questions, hypotheses, failed approaches, legal-review needs, or policy changes—are expected to be published to Commons through a future bounded integration. Publication will not make those records true or authoritative by itself.

## Why no new core Forge record type yet?

The rights/provenance specification is Incubating. Forge therefore consumes it through a versioned manifest and stores selection-time assessments in the already-supported extension mechanism instead of prematurely hard-coding a new persistent core record type.

Once experiment evidence shows the correct granularity and lifecycle, a future compatibility-reviewed change can introduce a dedicated immutable record if that is justified.

## Central invariant

> Technical status and rights/provenance status are independent evidence domains. Missing or unresolved rights evidence remains UNKNOWN; machine origin never manufactures a legal conclusion; policy determines whether that UNKNOWN is observed, advisory, or blocking.
